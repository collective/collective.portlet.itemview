Introduction
============

This portlet is close to collective.portlet.content. It let you choose a content
item and display it in a portlet through a selected view. By default there is
only one view, the default one: @@itemview_portlet.

Other add-ons can now provide a portlet just by adding a utility and a browser view.
The utility is to register a new kind of view and make it available through the portlet
add form. You can check collective.gallery and nmd.plonelinkasvideoembed.
